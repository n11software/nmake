some rando ideas go here/change requests
kept under version control cuz convenience is great

* Change #1: Actual GUI client
STATUS: Being discussed (gotta create an email thread for this)
The Way It Works Now:
	We only have a simple TUI client.

Proposed Change:
	Build an actual GUI client (built on [need to discuss]) to
	manage the build system directly, as well as create environments
	and all that other shit.

Rationale:
	Sometimes it makes life easier just to manage the build config
	through a GUI interface or at least have a separate window to
	manage this.
